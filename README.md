# timelapse-webcam

__status: WIP__

Java application for using the webcam to capture multiple images with a fixed repetition rate.

The application uses the (webcam-capture)[https://github.com/sarxos/webcam-capture]-library for access to the webcam and capturing the image and provides a GUI to set all needed parameters and to get a live preview of the recent image.
